		<h4>Two types of ways to be a Designated Driver</h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Team Lift: Where two guys come and one of them drives your car to your location and the other drives the other car following behind the other car.</li>
				<li>Team Scooter: Where a guy arrives on a special scooter that folds up and fits into a nice, compact carrying bag. He puts the scooter in the trunk of the car and drives you home in your car, then grabs his scooter and then drives away.</li>
				<li>Cost: I would recommend driving people for free just because it saves lives and I would see it as being caring and doing it for someone and not just for the money.</li>
				<li>Reservations: Someone can make a reservation for the DD to come to you and take you to your next location in your car so you won't end up with a ticket or even worse, you life or another's.</li>
