		<p>A Designated Driver is a driver who remains sober as a responsible driver while others are allowed to drink alcoholic beverages. He then drives the person(s) who have been drinking to their destination in the comfort of their own car. There are two types of ways to be a designated driver. First, the Team Lift where two people come and one of them drives your car and the other drives the drivers car behind you and the Team Scooter, where the guy arives on the scooter that can fold up and he puts it in your trunk and takes it out and rides away after he drops you off.</p>
		<p>The first arrest of drunk driving was made in 1897 by George Smith in the United Kingdom for admiting he was under the influence. New York was the first state that passed the first law against drinking and driving, Massachusetts was taking away licenses from people who were driving under the influence (DUI), and Indiana passed the first blood alcohol content (BAC)law whick set the legal limit at .15 in 1939.</p>
